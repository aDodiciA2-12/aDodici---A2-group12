										<h2 id="content">What does James</h2>
										<p>James is an IT professional who is a SME(Subject Matter Expert) in SEO(Standard Operating Environment) who specialises in SSCM(System Server Configuration Management). However, his job is slowly developing as an Desktop Infrastructure Engineer.
										James manages the network environmental system for the Sydney Local Health District.
										</p>

											<div>
												<h3>Information About his Industry</h3>
												<p>James works for the Sydney Local Health District, covering about 15,000 staff and approximately 11,000 computers across a couple of different hospitals throughout Sydney.
													As his work is involved in the hospital sector, there can be many risks involved in his day to day work as it can directly affect patients’ lives. The particular department
													James works for in the Sydney Local Health District is E-Health. The E-Health department specialises in the utilisation of IT to connect people, data and systems to improve
													patient-centred health care. They enable and integrate health care systems for patients and clinicians in the NSW community. James, also in the past, has worked for various
													other sectors, including schools, corporate, not for profit and healthcare.</p>


												<h3>The different kinds of work involved?</h3>
												<p>Although His roles have mostly been on the support side of things, his role has gradually evolved over the last few years as an Infrastructure Engineer. Currently, his work
													 is in the process of migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and the implementation of Windows Virtual Desktops. His work has also required him to learn about Azure Windows
													 Virtual Desktop, in which he mostly uses a free tool called WVD admin (Windows Virtual Desktop). WVD admin allows him to quickly take snapshots of drives, create new VMs (Virtual Machines)
													 and put them into the pools within the systems environment.</p>

											<!-- Break -->
											<h3>Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them?</h3>
											<p>James interacts with a variety of desktop support engineers, desktop infrastructure engineers, external vendors, security software engineers and other people within the Sydney Local Health District.</p>


												<h3>Interactions you have with other IT professionals?</h3>
												<p>Another requirement of James work is to help design solutions for SOE (Standard Operating Environments) and arranging how this new system solution will affect the current environment.
													When James is developing a project idea, he is required to understand what particular aspects of IT would benefit a specific faculty. He is also required to understand and organise what
													resources will be essential for project development and work out what other IT professionals will be needed for that specific project. If the project does require him to work with Software
													 Engineers, he has to determine whether their particular solution will fit the environment and ensure that it does not break it. If Software Engineers are required, their work will have to go
													 through the Security Software Engineering team to ensure there are no security flaws before deployment into the environment. He also has to consider whether a particular project is feasible and
													  understand what costs are involved in completing the project and whether it would outway the benefits. Will be required to outsource to an external vendor? The project also has to take in consideration
														whether it suits the company’s needs and does it align with what they do?
													Unlike James, the other members of his desktop support team do not have many tools to utilise as they mainly focus on using and dealing with active directories and deploying and moving computers around.</p>


												<h3>Interactions with clients and investors?</h3>
												<p>His work does not require him to interact with clients or investors because his department is mostly internal. However, James does have to cooperate with other faculties within the Sydney Local Health District. </p>

												<h3>Day to day work</h3>
												<p>On a day to day basis, James is mostly focused heavily on Group Policy, which requires him to use an SSEM (System Server Evaluation Module) which is a system and server management software tool.
													The SSEM application is mostly used for the deployment of applications, updating applications and windows updates.  As opposed to using a WSOS (Windows Switchgear Operating System) which is connected to a WSOS server,
													 they choose how it can be deployed within their current network environment. With this particular SSEM he is able to collect/track information about how a Fleet is performing within the organisation. </p>

													<h3>Challenging aspects of the job</h3>
													<p>A challenging aspect of James job requires him to also work with vendors, people who work for you but are external from the company. One of the biggest challenges in dealing with external vendors is communication.
														 Communication can sometimes break down. He’s learnt that once you have come to a contractual agreement; getting them to agree to it in multiple forms such as written, verbal and email to ensure that everyone is on
														 the same page. During the Covid epidemic, it has become a lot more difficult as you can’t meet with them face to face.</p>
													<p>Also, as external vendors are usually located outside of Australia, that could mean that they may have different operating hours and may take longer to respond to requests. James also mentioned another challenging
														 aspect is to get them to work outside of what they are generally capable of, as they may have policies in place to say that it is out of their standard capabilities.</p>

													<h3>An instance where something in IT didn’t go as planned?</h3>
													<p>James believes that in IT, you will always run into issues as things always generally don’t go as they are planned;  there are many moving cogs and communication breaks down a lot. Also, when you are dealing with
														 different vendors, they might not get something done within a specific time frame.</p>
													<p>An issue James has had in the past is the accidental deployment of an application which broke over 3000 computers. At the time the SSEN (Self Service Engine) that they were using belonged to a different department
														in which they didn’t have full control over. In the department James was in they were testing this application and had left it on. The other department removed a glitch in the deployment application causing the
														application to be deployed. He had to react quickly enough to get an immediate fix out, as it can affect the lives of patients. He also had to contact all the necessary people to ensure that everything was ok.
														He also said that he took responsibility for this situation and that staying calm under pressure was necessary to deal with it quickly and effectively.</p>

													<h3>Skillset development</h3>
													<p>As James role has progressed into a more senior role, he said that he is working towards improving his management skills as he is required to take over when the manager is not around. He is learning to develop
														his SOS management skills to be able to manage people, without bossing them around. He has found this is a useful skill, through any level of work that he has been doing.</p>
													<p>James is also learning how to use Azure tools. Learning it from the ground up to develop a solution within a couple of weeks to allow people to work from home and also ensure that it is secure and that it will
														work the way, they intend it to. Also he has aimed to develop an environment that people can use and not be frustrated with, that is cost efficient.</p>

													<h3>The Essence of IT</h3>
													<p>James believes the essence of IT is the automation of everything as much as possible; the less you are required to communicate, the fewer problems you have and the better you do.</p>
